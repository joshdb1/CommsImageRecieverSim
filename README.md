# CommsSystemRecieverSim

This program python simulates an image communications system receiver implemented in `rx.py`. The simulation includes demodulation, matched filtering, and phase and timing synchronization using PLL's. The receiver takes a raw signal as input and outputs the received image.

The system diagram for the receiver implemented is below:

To run the simulations, run the command (using Python 3.9 or later): `python ./runSims.py`
